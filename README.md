Senior_Design: 2-Axis Pitot Tube Scanner 
================================
Introduction: What is a 2-Axis Pitot Tube Scanner?
------------------------------
The 2-Axis Pitot Scanning system uses a pitot tube to scan the velocity profile in the wake of aerodynamic bodies and calculate the momentum deficit for drag analysis. A 2-axis carrage is driven by stepper motors into position and measures pressure downstream using a pressure differential analog sensor. To better visulize this system, check out the CAD models below (thanks Biran Orr!).

Our scanning system consists of a pitot tube mounted on the end of of a 2-axis carriage which is driven by stepper motors. This will measure pressure across a plane downstream of an aerodynamic body of interest. A microcontroller will handle user specifications, motion control, and computations on the collected pressure sensor data. Users will interact with the system through an IPython Notebook environment. The final system is designed to fit with the dimensions of the clientâ€™s wind tunnel and be accurate for airspeeds ranging from 1-30 miles per hour. The 2-Axis Pitot Scanning system will greatly assist professors and students with aerodynamic research and education by demonstrating bernoulli's law and finding drag of bodies for reference.
